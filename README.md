# Guessing-Game
Project done as an exercise from the JavaScript course I'm taking in Udemy. Basically you have to guess a number from 1 to 20. If your number is lower or higher than the 'randomized number', you're gonna get a message for both cases. You're also gonna get a message if you don't input any value. For every mistake you'll lose 1 point on the score. Again button resets the form.
